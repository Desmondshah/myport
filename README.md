# Portfolio Website with TypeScript & Convex

This project is a starter for a portfolio website using TypeScript for the frontend and Convex as the backend.

## Key Files

   - `npm install` (frontend)
   - `npm install convex` (backend)
2. Initialize Convex:
   - `npx convex init`
3. Set up authentication as needed (see Convex docs).
4. Generate TypeScript types:
   - `npx convex codegen`
5. Start the development server:
   - `npm run dev`

## VS Code Settings
