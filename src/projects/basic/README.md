Included examples:

- IP Address Lookup – Fetch public IP and show location, ISP / org, timezone (ipify + ipapi).
- Local Network Device Finder – Safe-mode parser for pasted ARP / neighbor table output (IP + MAC only) demonstrating passive discovery concepts.
- Internet Speed Test – Approximate browser-based latency / download / upload measurement using public endpoints.
- Basic Encryption Tool – Demonstrates reversible Caesar shift and Base64 encoding/decoding (educational, not secure cryptography).
- Password Leak Demo – k-anonymity style check against Pwned Passwords API using first 5 SHA-1 hash chars only (educational; never test real passwords).
